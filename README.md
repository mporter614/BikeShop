# BikeShop

## Getting Started

Navigate to the src folder of this repo (ie. bike-shop/src) in a terminal, to get there from the top level after cloning this will take running a `cd bike-shop/src` to reach the Angular section of the repo. After this, running `npm install` (or `npm i` for short) will update npm packages referenced in the package.json that are needed to run the application, including Angular itself (if needed, according to the semantic versioning within the package.json). From there, run `ng serve --open` to start serving the Angular application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:4200/`.

(If using VS Code, you can open a terminal with Ctrl+`)

# BikeShop

## Getting Started

Navigate to the src folder of this repo (ie. bike-shop/src) in a terminal, to get there from the top level after cloning this will take running a `cd bike-shop/src` to reach the Angular section of the repo. From there, run `ng serve --open` to start serving the Angular application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:4200/`.

(If using VS Code, you can open a terminal with Ctrl+`)
